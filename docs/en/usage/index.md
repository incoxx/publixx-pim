# Usage Guide

Welcome to the Publixx PIM usage guide. This chapter is intended for all users who work with the system on a daily basis: from product managers and data stewards to export administrators.

## Overview

The Publixx PIM user interface is a modern single-page application built with Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI. After logging in, you'll reach the dashboard from which all functional areas are accessible via the sidebar.

## Key Areas

### Products

Create, edit, and manage products including their attributes, variants, media, and prices.

### Attributes

Configure the attribute system — define attribute types, units, value lists, and attribute views to structure your product data.

### Hierarchies

Build and manage category trees, assign products to hierarchy nodes, and configure node-specific attribute assignments.

### Import

Import product data from Excel files with validation, mapping, and preview capabilities.

### Export

Export product data in JSON format or as Publixx catalog exports using PXF templates.

### Users & Permissions

Manage user accounts, roles, and permissions to control access to the system.
